# CheMLT-F
A Framework for standardized drug processing along with a family of pre-trained Multitask Transformer Models (DeBERTa) adapted for Chemical Analysis, Drug Property and Binding Affinity Prediction.

The models are fully extendable to additional datasets and are simple to modify & retrain under a standardized pipeline.

At the moment, the models support 13 different drug datasets

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

This project provides **two ways** to install dependencies:

### Option 1: Conda (recommended)

Create a new environment from the provided YAML file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate myenv
```

### Option 2: Pip (alternative)

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On Linux / macOS**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

- **On Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
