# CheMLT-F
A Framework for standardized drug processing along with a family of pre-trained Multitask Transformer Models (DeBERTa) adapted for Chemical Analysis, Drug Property and Binding Affinity Prediction.

The models are fully extendable to additional datasets and are simple to modify & retrain under a standardized pipeline.

At the moment, the models support 13 different drug datasets
